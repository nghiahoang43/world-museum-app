        solution: "We propose the following solutions: 3D imaging scanning for large objects, high-resolution scanners for digitizing assemblages and paper-based objects, a microscope with a digital camera for capturing detailed images of frozen tissue samples, and dedicated equipment for converting analog audiovisual content into digital formats. These recommendations address specific requirements efficiently and professionally.",

        name: "AI/ML solutions for analysis of unstructured data",
        solution: "We suggest utilizing free open-source software tools like Tesseract OCR, BERT language models, and OpenCV library for AI model training. These tools enable the extraction and recognition of language or texts, facilitating the reconstruction of unreadable paragraphs or visual contents for objects such as paper-based, pinned, assemblages. Additionally, sentiment information can be understood and applied, maximizing objectives while minimizing costs.",

        name: "Sensor-based technologies for item location tracking and digital registry",
        solution: "We utilize sensor-based technologies like RFID tags, barcode labels, and environment/temperature sensors to digitally track and locate objects. These technologies streamline asset registration, reduce manual work, and enable safe and efficient handling of special objects such as liquid-preserved items and frozen tissue samples.",
